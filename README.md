COURSE-HATEOAS

<p>This is an experiment project. In this project I have used Spring HATEOAS.</p>

<ol>
<li>createCourse - POST operation to create a course</li>
<li>showCourses - GET operation to retrieve all courses</li>
<li>getCourse - GET operation to retrieve a course</li>
<li>updateCourse - PUT operation to update a course</li>
<li>cancelCourse - DELETE operation to cancel a course</li>
</ol>
